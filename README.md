# real-estate-spatial-price-analysis
This project explores the spatial distribution of real estate prices using Python, GeoPandas, and Google Earth Engine. It combines geospatial and statistical analysis to uncover how factors such as location, accessibility, neighborhood characteristics, and proximity to urban centers influence property values.
# 🏡 Real Estate Spatial Price Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project applies spatial data science techniques to analyze and visualize real estate price patterns. Using **Python**, **GeoPandas**, and **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**, the analysis explores how property prices vary with respect to **location**, **accessibility**, **neighborhood amenities**, and **distance to central business districts (CBDs)**.  

The goal is to showcase how spatial data and machine learning can be combined to gain actionable insights into urban development, market segmentation, and investment decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and prepare real estate spatial data for analysis.  
- Clean, merge, and visualize geographic and tabular datasets.  
- Explore the relationship between property prices and spatial factors (e.g., proximity to key services, population density).  
- Use **statistical and predictive models** to estimate price trends and spatial clusters.  
- Present results through **interactive maps** and **data visualizations**.
